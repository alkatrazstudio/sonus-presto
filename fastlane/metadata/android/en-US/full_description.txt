A bare-bones music player.
Intended to utilize a filesystem to browse your music instead of automatically grouping by artist, album or genre.
Focused on gesture controls.
Supports CUE sheets, M3U playlists and Internet radio.


Here's what you can do in SonusPresto:

* play music

* browse your music in the way you have structured it, using the filesystem

* play all files in a selected folder and sub-folders recursively

* open CUE sheets and M3U playlists as folders

* gapless playback

* play Internet radio from M3U playlists

* change a visual theme and language (English/Russian)

* control a playback using touch and swipe gestures on a single button

* listen to the audio from the video files


Here's what SonusPresto can't do:

* view audio tags or cover art

* quickly set a precise playback position

* view the current playback position in seconds

* use a separate buttons to control a playback (i.e. there's no separate prev/stop/next/... buttons)

* create custom playlists or manage a playback queue

* basically, anything else that is not listed in the previous section :)

Disclaimer: new features will most likely never be added.


Here are some quirks:

* the swiping of the bottom button may not work on some devices with specific Android gesture settings

* since SonusPresto doesn't read tags, it can't determine actual artist and album name of a music track and instead it just uses folder names for that (except for playlist items)

* SonusPresto may not be compatible with LastFM scrobblers, i.e. it will most likely send incorrect info because it does not use tags

* SonusPresto doesn't know what formats your device supports, so it will just show every file that has any of the supported extensions (i.e. not all displayed files can actually be played if your device does not support them)


This application does not collect any user data. It only uses the Internet to play Internet radio.
